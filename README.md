This repository contains scripts to be used during the PRE-INGEST part of your institution's Archivematica workflow. 
These scripts allow Archivematica users to identify and reformat files which will NOT be automatically normalized during the system's ingest transfer process. Normalizing files refers to the process by which all files of a particular type (video files, audio files, images, text documents, etc.) are converted to a specific file format. Usually, this format is chosen for accessibility. At the same time, the original file format is still kept for preservation purposes.
For example, Word documents do not get normalized in Archivematica. Our policy states we must keep the Word document as part of the collection. But we would still like to have a copy accessible to patrons. In this case, we chose the PDF format as our proxy format to normalize to.
Aside from the scripts that have been shared, we have provided a comprehensive list of file formats that DO NOT get normalized during Archivematica's ingest processes. We've named this file "Formats-AM-Will-Not-Normalize_LIST."
The scripts and their corresponding READ ME text files (which include instructions for the use of the scripts) are numbered in the order in which they should be used.
The first script (formatcounter.py and README) requires the use of the DROID file identification tool first before running the script. DROID will identify all of the formats within a package and that data can be exported into a CSV. The formatcounter.py script will then be run on the CSV. The script will produce a report listing all of the formats in the package and will identify whether or not Archivematica will normalize the format. Once it's been determined there are formats Archivematica will not convert, you can refer back to the CSV to find the actual location of each individual file.
The next scripts are all used to convert formats. We have 3 conversion scripts so far, DOC (Word)-to-PDF, RTF-to-PDF and PPT-to-PDF. These scripts will require a dedicated folder within your institutions hard drive. The scripts will run on any and all packages within this dedicated folder. The scripts dive down into each package and recursively search through each sub-folder looking for specific file formats. The script then converts and properly names the new access copy.
Please be aware that you WILL be creating new files, thereby increasing the size of your package.
Please be aware that some file format conversions MAY NOT be necessary. For example, a collection may be comprised of many TIFF files. Your policy may be to make copies on demand. Therefore, you would not need to convert the TIFF files.
