The "Doc to PDF" python script, developed by Steven Loyd for use here at Rice University, was created to assist archivists batch convert Word documents to PDF files prior to ingesting content through Archivematica (AM). 

AM will not automatically copy and convert (normalize) a variety of preservation master file formats. In this case, Word documents will not normalize to PDF for access purposes. 

Since Word documents (.doc, .docx) are the most common format in unprocessed collections that require nortmalization, Steven developed the "Doc to PDF" script to batch convert the large number of Word docs held within a given collection. The python file is named "doc-to-pdf.py". PLEASE NOTE: This script is held in a "Conversion" sub-folder within our Unprocessed-aips Transfer Source location. The script will run on the entire "Conversion" folder, whether you have one package in it or several. The script looks through every folder and sub-folder held within the "Conversion" location and will create a PDF of every Word doc it finds. 

Here are step-by-step instructions for the doc-to-pdf.py script:

AIPs that need Word doc conversion must be placed in the "Conversion" sub-folder within the appropriate Transfer Source directory
Run doc-to-pdf.py. 
This can be done in two ways:
Simply double click the file.
OR
Shift + right-click in the folder and click "Open PowerShell window here." In the PowerShell window, input "python doc-to-pdf.py".
Note that only the PowerShell method will allow you to see errors, should any occur. If you double click the script and it doesn't produce a report, you should run it in PowerShell and see what's happening.
POWERSHELL IS THE PREFERRED OPTION

Please be aware:
The script will run on any and all AIPs placed in the Conversion folder (can be just 1 AIP at a time or several batched together)
The script will create PDF copies of all of the respective DOC/DOCX files within the AIP
