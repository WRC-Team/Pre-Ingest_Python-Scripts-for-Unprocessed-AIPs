This TXT file lists all of the formats that Archivematica WILL normalize. 
This list is used by the "formatcounter.py" script to create a report that gives a simplified list of which formats in a package will or will not be normalized (the formats are listed and designated as either YES or NO). 
It also shows how many of each file format there are in the package.
Please keet the "normal)formats.txt" file in the same directory as the "formatcounter.py" script!
